GWAS summary statistics data GWAS summary statistics data should be in plain text or gzipped text format containing the following columns: SNP rs ID of the SNP (e.g. rs62442). CHR Chromosome number of the SNP. This should be a number between 1 and 22. BP Base pair position of the SNP. A1 Effect allele of the SNP. The sign of the Z-score is with respect to this allele. A2 The other allele of the SNP. Z The Z-score of the SNP. N Sample size of the SNP. Note : This file format is compatible with LDSC . Other columns (e.g. MAF, INFO, etc.) may be included in the file, but will not be used. It is also recommended [although not required] that the summary data files are sorted by their chromosomes and base pairs.
